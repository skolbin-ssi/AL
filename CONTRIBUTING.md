## Reporting issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in the AL compiler or developer tools? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Identify where to report

The Dynamics 365 Business Central team accepts feedback through multiple channels and repositories. Try to file the issue through the correct channel to ensure that your issue is addressed effectively and efficiently.

#### **Security vulnerabilities**
Please follow the instructions in this [document](SECURITY.MD) to ensure that the issue is handled with the highest priority.

#### **Bugs**
For bugs in the latest version of the AL language extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al) or any of the static analysis tools that accompany the AL Language extension, use the current [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/al). You should always use the latest version of the AL Language extension when targeting any version of Business Central. 

If you are targeting Dynamics NAV 2018 or older, you must use the AL extension provided in the DVD and use the [support channel](#support) to report issues.

For issues concerning versions of Business Central that are in mainstream support you should use the [support channel](#support).

#### **Extensibility of first-party AL applications**
For issues related to the extensibility of applications authored by Microsoft, such as the `System Application` or the `Base Application`, use the [ALAppExtensions](https://github.com/Microsoft/ALAppExtensions) repository.

#### **Feature requests and suggestions**
For new features in AL/Visual Studio Code language and tools, as well as Business Central in general, use [Business Central Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas). 

For suggestions for new static analysis rules or improvements to existing static analysis rules, use [Business Central Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas).

Posting your suggestion on [Business Central Ideas](https://aka.ms/bcideas) will allow other members of the community to vote on your idea and will allow us to prioritize based accordingly.

### Look for an existing issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/microsoft/AL/issues) to see if the issue has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/microsoft/AL/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+) issues, and vote on/add to existing issue if applicable.

If you find that your issue already exists in this repository, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing good bug reports

File a single issue per problem. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Use the latest version of the AL language extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al) or shipped as part of the [AL Developer Preview builds](README.md#al-developer-preview-builds) for Dynamics 365 Business Central.

Disable all extensions except the AL Language extension.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

**1. Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. 

**2. To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '...'

``` AL code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally ```

**Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

**3. Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**4. Actual behavior**
A clear and concise description of what happened accompanied by images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring.

**5. Versions:**

- AL Language. Go to Visual Studio Code ‚Üí Extensions panel ‚Üí AL Language 
- Visual Studio Code: Go to Visual Studio Code ‚Üí Help ‚Üí About
- Business Central. In the web client, go to Help ‚Üí Help and Support ‚Üí Troubleshooting
- List of Visual Studio Code extensions that you have installed. Go to Visual Studio Code ‚Üí Extensions panel

### Final checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure you are reporting a new issue

* [ ] Reproduce the issue after switching off all extensions except the AL Language extension

* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

### Follow your issue

Once submitted, your issue will through the [issue tracking](https://github.com/microsoft/AL/wiki/Issue-Tracking) workflow. Please read the document to understand what will happen next, so that you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.
